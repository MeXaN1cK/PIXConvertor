# PIXConverter
Created by MeXaN1cK; written in C++ using QT Creator.

Converts images to OpenComputers PIX image format.

### Features of the format
* Small file size
* Half-block pixel support, allowing for twice as bigger max image height
* Convenient converter included (well, as you may have guessed, I'm talking
  about this repo, yeah)
* High render speed â€” probably, relatively, whatever
* Simple binary structure
